### What I learned

Through the journey of working on my project, PupQuest, I've not only acquired proficiency in a range of new technologies but also gained a profound comprehension of the intricate workings of websites. This project served as a crucible for learning, where I delved into the realms of web development, embracing Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap, while harnessing the power of Passport.js for authentication. Beyond the technical aspects, PupQuest has been a revelation in the way it has crystallized my understanding of how websites operate holistically.
